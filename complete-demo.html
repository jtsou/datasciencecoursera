#Write a function that reads a directory full of files and reports the number
#of completely observed cases in each data file. 
#The function should return a data frame where the first column is the name of the file 
#and the second column is the number of complete cases.
#A prototype of this function follows

complete <- function(directory, id=1:332){
  ##directory is the location of csv files
  ## id is the integer vector
  ## return df in the form:
  # id nobs(number of complete cases)
  #1   117
  #2  1041
  nobs <- numeric()
  location <- list.files(directory)[id]
  read <- paste('specdata','/',location,sep="")
  for (i in read) {
    read_file <- read.csv(i)
    nobs <- c(nobs, sum(complete.cases(read_file)))
  }
    return (data.frame(id,nobs))
